	<h2>Markets and Assets</h2>
	<p>IQ Option offers broad coverage of assets that can be traded across markets:</p>
	<h3>Forex</h3>
	<p>
		The foreign exchange market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. On IQ
		Option, you can access CFDs on over 40 currency pairs, including:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Major pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY)</li>
		<li>Minor pairs (EUR/GBP, AUD/CAD)</li>
		<li>Exotic pairs (USD/TRY, EUR/ZAR)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Forex trading on IQ Option is available with leverages up to 1:500, allowing you to control
		larger positions with relatively minimum investments. However, remember that while leverage
		amplifies potential profits, it also increases potential losses.

	<h3>Stocks</h3>

	<p>
		IQ Option offers access to over 150 company stocks from major global exchanges. You can trade
		shares of technology giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, as well as established
		corporations from various sectors, including Amazon, Tesla, Nike, and McDonald's.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stock trading on the platform is conducted through Contracts for Difference (CFDs), which means
		you're speculating on price movements without owning the actual shares. CFD trading allows for
		both long (buy) and short (sell) positions, providing flexibility regardless of market
		direction.
	</p>

	<h3>Options</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Binary Options </strong>
			<p>
				Basic type of trading where you wager whether an asset will increase or decrease over a
				specified period. The returns typically fall between 75% and 95% if you accurately predict
				them. Binary options are no longer available to retail investors in the European Economic
				Area due to regulatory restrictions.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Digital Options </strong>
			<p>
				An evolution of binary options with more flexibility and higher potential returns (up to
				900% in some cases). Digital options offer more strategic options without specified risk
				parameters.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
